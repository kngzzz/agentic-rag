# Progress: JARVIS 2.0 (As of May 2025)

## 1. What Works (Post-Refactoring)

*   **Core Weaviate Integration & Server Startup:**
    *   The backend application (`main.py`) now starts successfully with Uvicorn when run from the project root (`c:/projects/jarvis/`).
    *   Python import paths and `.env` file loading are correctly configured.
    *   The backend services (`ingestion_service`, `retrieval_service`, `agent_service`) are successfully using the Weaviate Python client obtained via `backend/core/weaviate_manager.py`.
    *   `weaviate_manager.py` correctly initializes the client and successfully creates the "Documents" collection schema in Weaviate upon startup if it doesn't exist.
    *   API routers (`ingest.py`, `query.py`) have been updated to remove old database dependencies and correctly call the refactored services.
*   **Data Ingestion (Initial Test):**
    *   While a specific ingestion test for a *new* file hasn't been performed in this session, the successful query about "Google ADK" implies that data previously ingested (or pre-existing in Weaviate) is accessible.
*   **Data Retrieval & Agent Service (Initial Test):**
    *   A query ("tell me about google's ADK") was successfully processed.
    *   The `retrieval_service` successfully fetched relevant chunks from Weaviate.
    *   The `agent_service` successfully used these chunks with the LangChain ReAct agent to generate a coherent answer.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   Weaviate and OpenAI settings are managed through `backend/core/config.py` and a `.env` file.
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   `weaviate-client` is the confirmed primary database dependency in `backend/requirements.txt`.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Immediate Next Steps

1.  **Thorough End-to-End Testing (Structured):**
    *   **Status:** Partially complete (initial successful query). Further structured testing (e.g., ingesting a known new file and querying it) is advisable to fully confirm ingestion pipeline.
    *   **Details:** Test ingestion of a new sample text file and subsequent querying to ensure the entire refactored pipeline works as expected.
2.  **Documentation Update:**
    *   **Status:** Complete (as of 2025-05-08).
    *   **Details:** Updated `docs/DESIGN.MD`, `docs/INSTALLATION.MD`, and `docs/tech_stack.md` to reflect the current Weaviate-centric architecture, server startup procedures, and corrected technology details. Memory Bank files (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) also updated.
3.  **JSON Ingestion Feature:**
    *   **Status:** Planned. This is the first new feature post-refactoring.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Modify `ingestion_service.py` to handle `.json` file uploads.
        *   Implement logic to parse JSON structures (specifically from AI platform exports like ChatGPT, Claude). This might involve identifying conversational turns, user/assistant messages, or other relevant fields.
        *   Ensure extracted text content is appropriately chunked, embedded, and stored in Weaviate with relevant metadata (e.g., source filename, original JSON structure if needed for context).
        *   Update `backend/api/routers/ingest.py` if necessary to accommodate any changes in how JSON files are handled or reported.
4.  **Further New Features (Longer Term, from `projectbrief.md`):**
    *   Expanding other content ingestion types.
    *   Implementing API authentication.
    *   Adding support for local LLM configurations.
    *   Enhancing agent capabilities (explainability, confidence scores).
    *   UI/UX improvements.

## 3. Current Overall Status

*   **Core Backend Refactoring & Startup:** Complete and Verified. The system is architecturally aligned with using Weaviate, and the server starts correctly.
*   **Stability:** Initial stability confirmed by a successful query. Further testing will build more confidence.
*   **Feature Completeness:** Basic RAG pipeline (ingest, retrieve, answer) is confirmed to be functional. Ready for expansion with new features like JSON ingestion.

## 4. Known Issues / Risks (Updated)

*   **Untested Ingestion of *New* Files (This Session):** While querying existing data works, the full pipeline for ingesting a *new* file in this session and then querying it hasn't been explicitly performed. This is a minor risk, to be addressed by the next testing step.
*   **`backend/models/document.py` Obsolescence:** The `Document` Pydantic model is likely no longer used. This isn't an "issue" but a piece of code that might need formal deprecation or removal to avoid confusion.
*   **Scalability Under Load:** Performance under heavy load or with very large datasets in Weaviate has not yet been tested.
*   **Security:** API endpoints are currently unauthenticated (API authentication is a planned feature).

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

*   **Initial State (Pre-Refactor):** Ambiguity regarding the database stack (mentions of PostgreSQL, FAISS). A `WeaviateDBService` abstraction was in place.
*   **User Directive:** Explicit instruction to use Weaviate as the primary and sole vector database.
*   **Refactoring Decision:** Remove the `WeaviateDBService` abstraction and have services directly use the Weaviate client managed by `weaviate_manager.py`. This was done to simplify the architecture, give more direct control to services, and align better with Weaviate client library usage.
*   **Current State:** Standardized on Weaviate, direct client usage pattern established, server starts successfully, and initial RAG pipeline functionality confirmed.

This `progress.md` file will be updated as tasks are completed, new issues arise, and further decisions are made, providing a living history of the project's development.
