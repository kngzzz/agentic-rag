## 1. Introduction & Executive Summary

JARVIS 2.0 is an evolution of our personal knowledge management platform, designed as a privacy-first, agentic RAG system that serves as a true "second brain" for users. The platform ingests content from multiple sources (including major AI platforms, PDFs, images, and web content), applies advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation with sophisticated reasoning capabilities, and organizes knowledge in a structured memory system.

**Problem Statement:**
- Users now engage with multiple AI platforms, creating fragmented knowledge across systems
- Information volume has increased dramatically, making manual organization impossible
- Existing solutions lack reasoning capabilities to connect insights across sources
- Privacy concerns have intensified, requiring stronger data protection measures

**Opportunity:**
- Create the definitive unified knowledge system with cross-platform support
- Implement an enterprise-grade memory system based on knowledge graph principles
- Develop advanced reasoning capabilities that explain their process and confidence
- Establish an open, extensible architecture that encourages community innovation
